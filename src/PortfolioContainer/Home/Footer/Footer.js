                                Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Oke Omoge, and I'm a graduate of the University of Benin, Benin City, Edo State. Additionally, I hold a NCE in Mathematics/Geography from Adeyemi College of Education.

                                With a curious mind and a thirst for knowledge, I'm constantly in wonder of how things work and have an eagerness to learn new things. My journey into the world of software development began with training from Alt_School, where I honed my skills and discovered my passion for coding.

                                I pride myself on being loyal, hardworking, and always ready to embrace new challenges. Whether it's diving into the intricacies of a new technology stack or tackling complex problem-solving, I approach each task with dedication and enthusiasm.

                                I'm excited to share my journey and showcase the projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!
